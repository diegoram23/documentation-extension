## How to tweak this project for your own uses

Since this is targeted towards physical therapists working in skilled nursing facility rehab, I'd encourage you to clone and rename this project to use for your own puposes. It's a good starter boilerplate.

## Note: This project is not intended to be visually appealing

This project is intended to be simple and easy to follow to allow the user to quickly access what they need and generate
their text to add to their documentation. This project is not HTML/CSS heavy but it works and will improve your documentation productivity
